Traditionally, restaurants had their menus in paper/booklet form. In the early mobile revolution from 2004 to 2008, some restaurants gave waiters a mobile with a custom app loaded in it for taking orders from customers. Now, tablets are given to the customers for them to browse food menus and place their orders.
This trend is in market from mid-2011 onwards and its gaining momentum now. Customers will be able to browse the food menu and place their order which eventually gets posted in the kitchen display console.<br>
